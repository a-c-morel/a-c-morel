### Hi there ! 👋

I am **Adeline**, a french **Frontend Developer** you will enjoy working with ! ✨👩‍💻

I used to be a teacher 👩‍🏫 : a childhood dream come true. 🤩 But childhood dreams, sometimes, are just well... dreams, and I realized my real passion was making **dynamic**, **accessible**, **beautiful** and **performant** websites. How come ? I think it is the people I met, and friends I made along the way that made me realize. I was always listening to my developers friends talking of the projects they were working on, and what I was hearing was **passion**, **passion**, and **passion**.
At the university, we had a writing assessment to do on a profession, and with my workgroup we chose to interview an e-learning developer. I think a seed 🌱 was sown in my brain at that exact moment. I didn't had a great look at it first because it was so tiny : I almost forgot it and continued my studies to become a teacher. But some day, as I was finally teaching, the seed became... a tree. 🌳 For me, this man we met was like a wizard you came to see, expressing your needs : "I would like my shop to have an app on which sellers can train themselves on their department" : okay, done ! "I want to be able to visualize in 3D the human organs so that my interns can learn anatomy" : also done ! What else do you need ? 🧙‍♂️
I began to learn HTML, CSS at first, as a hobby (I was still a teacher at the time). Then, I decided to take a year without teaching to think about what I really wanted to do with it. And I was so happy learning to code, that I decided to take a step further and to go to a school to learn JavaScript, React and... I quit my job ! Back to studies. For 2 years. And now... I am proud to be a wizard myself ! 🧙‍♀️✨

- 🔭 I’m currently working on WindCharm... another weather app ! I know, I know, there are already sooo many out there. But hey look ! It will be made with Next.js and Tailwind CSS ! How cool is that. I also try to contribute to open-source, please be forgiving if I make rookie mistakes.
- 📚 I’m currently learning eco-design, clean code, TDD, Next.js, and improving my React knowledge. This list is a non-exhaustive list as I am a frenetic and enthusiastic learner : I honestly never stop.
- 👯 I’m looking for a team to work with, to share and build together, with eco-design, accessibility and great performances in mind. Hire me ! Won't be disappointed 😇
